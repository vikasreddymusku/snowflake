# DQL - Joins 
- A join in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
- The related column is typically a foreign key in one table that references the primary key in another table.
- Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query, enabling you to correlate data from different sources.

## Joins in Snowflake: 
### INNER JOIN: 
- An INNER JOIN returns rows from both tables where there is a match based on the join condition.
- If there is no match between the tables, the rows are not included in the result set.
```sql
-- Retrieve employee information along with their department names
SELECT e.*, d.dname
FROM employees.emp e
INNER JOIN employees.dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno;
```

### LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): 
- A LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table (the first table in the JOIN clause) and the matched rows from the right table.
- If there is no match for a row in the left table, NULL values are filled in for the columns of the right table.
```sql
-- Retrieve all employees along with their department names,
-- including employees without a department
SELECT e.*, d.dname
FROM employees.emp e
LEFT JOIN employees.dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno;
```
### RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): 
- A RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table (the second table in the JOIN clause) and the matched rows from the left table.
- If there is no match for a row in the right table, NULL values are filled in for the columns of the left table.
```sql
-- Retrieve all departments along with their employees,
-- including departments without employees
SELECT e.*, d.dname
FROM employees.emp e
RIGHT JOIN employees.dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno;
```
### FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): 
- A FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables, including rows where there is no match based on the join condition.
- If a row in one table has no matching row in the other table, NULL values are filled in for the columns of the table without a match.
```sql
-- Retrieve all employees and departments,
-- including those without a match in the other table
SELECT e.*, d.dname
FROM employees.emp e
FULL JOIN employees.dept d ON e.deptno = d.deptno;
```
### CROSS JOIN: 
- A CROSS JOIN, also known as a Cartesian join, is a join operation that returns the Cartesian product of the two tables involved.
- In other words, it generates all possible combinations of rows from the tables without any condition or predicate.
- Each row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.
```sql
-- Retrieve all possible combinations of emp and dept tables
SELECT e.*, d.*
FROM employees.emp e
CROSS JOIN employees.dept d;
```
