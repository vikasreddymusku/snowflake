Workflow Example
```python
# Connecting to Snowflake
import snowflake.snowpark as snowpark

def main(session: snowpark.Session):
    # Query data directly
    df = session.sql("SELECT * FROM customer_data")
    
    # Perform analysis
    result = df.groupBy("region").agg({"sales": "sum"})
    
    # Visualize results
    result.show()
```
Best Practices
* Modularize code
* Use version control
* Document analysis steps
* Leverage Snowflake's built-in optimization

| Feature                     | Snowflake Notebooks              | Databricks Notebooks with Snowflake | Python Pandas Notebooks with Snowflake |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Querying & analyzing Snowflake data | Advanced analytics, ML, ETL with Snowflake | Data analysis & ETL with Snowflake |
| **Environment**             | Snowflake UI (Snowsight)       | Databricks (Apache Spark)         | Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab |
| **Compute Engine**          | Snowflake Virtual Warehouse    | Databricks Spark Clusters         | Local machine or cloud VM          |
| **Performance Optimization** | Automatic query optimization   | Uses Spark's distributed engine   | Relies on Pandas' single-node processing |
| **Concurrency**             | High (native Snowflake engine) | High (Spark parallel execution)   | Low (limited by Pandas & hardware) |
| **Scalability**             | Automatic scaling              | Scales with Spark clusters        | Limited by local hardware          |
| **Machine Learning Support**| Limited (Snowpark for ML)      | Strong ML/AI support (MLflow, Spark ML) | External ML libraries (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) |
| **Data Handling**           | SQL-based, structured & semi-structured data | Structured, semi-structured, & unstructured | Mostly structured, limited semi-structured |
| **Ease of Use**             | Easy (SQL-based, UI-driven)    | Moderate (Python/SQL/Spark)       | Moderate (Python/Pandas familiarity required) |
| **Integration with Snowflake** | Native                        | Via Spark Connector (JDBC)        | Via Snowflake Connector (Python)   |
| **Cost Efficiency**         | Pay-per-query (Snowflake pricing) | Requires Databricks + Snowflake costs | Low-cost (pay only for Snowflake) |
| **Best Use Cases**          | BI reporting, SQL analytics    | Big data ETL, ML, real-time analytics | Ad-hoc analysis, small-scale ETL  |
| **Pros**                    | - Easy SQL-based queries  <br> - No infrastructure management  <br> - Native Snowflake optimizations  <br> - Good for BI tools | - Distributed processing (handles large datasets)  <br> - Strong ML and AI capabilities  <br> - Supports Python, SQL, Scala  <br> - Good for real-time & batch ETL | - Lightweight & simple to use  <br> - Full Python ecosystem (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)  <br> - Low-cost (runs on local/cloud VMs)  <br> - Good for exploratory analysis |
| **Cons**                    | - Limited for big data ETL & ML  <br> - No custom Python packages  <br> - Limited interactivity | - Higher cost (Databricks + Snowflake)  <br> - Complexity in setup & maintenance  <br> - Requires Spark knowledge | - Performance limitations for large datasets  <br> - No built-in parallelism (single-threaded Pandas)  <br> - Requires Snowflake connector setup |


### Key Takeaways
* Snowflake Notebooks: Great for SQL-based analytics, BI, and structured data queries but lacks advanced ML & ETL capabilities.
* Databricks Notebooks with Snowflake: Best for big data, ML, and real-time analytics but has higher complexity and cost.
* Python Pandas Notebooks with Snowflake: Best for ad-hoc analysis and small-scale ETL but lacks performance on large datasets.
