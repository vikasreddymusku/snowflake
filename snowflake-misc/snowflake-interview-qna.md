## Snowflake Architecture, Basics
* Architecture
  * Database Storage
  * Query Processing
  * Cloud Services
* Warehouse, Role, Database, Schema and Table
  * Virtual Warehouse | Virtual data warehouse
    * They are compute clusters that power the modern data warehouse, 
    acting as an on-demand resource. It is is an independent compute resource that 
    can be leveraged at any time for SQL execution.
  * Role
    * An entity to which privileges can be granted. Roles are in turn assigned to users.
      Note that roles can also be assigned to other roles, creating a role hierarchy.

## Pandas, boto3
## Partitioning
## Snowpark
* Snowpark is a set of libraries and runtimes that lets you securely deploy and 
  process non-SQL code – like Python, Java, and Scala, directly within Snowflake.
* Process data in your preferred language with familiar languages like Python, Java, 
  or Scala for data manipulation, transformations, and analysis.
* **Pushdown processing**: Snowpark pushes down computations to the Snowflake engine,
  This means non-SQL code at the data, eliminating the need for data movement for 
  performance boosting.
* **Build diverse applications**: Develop data pipelines, machine learning models, 
  web applications, and more – all within the Snowflake platform.
* **Seamless integration**: Snowpark seamlessly integrates with existing Snowflake 
  features like user-defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures.

## Replication
## Stage
* Stage is a virtual location or container where external data files are stored before being loaded into Snowflake tables.
* Stages can be located in cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or on an on-premises file system.
* Stages support different file formats, such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro
  Snowflake can automatically recognize and load data from files in these formats.
* **Loading Data** into Snowflake tables from stages using the COPY INTO command.
* Stages act as an intermediate data storage locations. Data from here is ingested into Snowflake tables.
* **Unloading Data** from Snowflake tables to a stage using the COPY INTO command with a stage as the target.
```sql
-- Create an external stage pointing to an S3 bucket
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_s3_stage
  URL = 's3://your-s3-bucket/'
  CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID = 'your-access-key-id' AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key')
  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"');
```

## SnowPipe

## Time Travel
In Snowflake, Time Travel is a built-in feature that is available for all tables by default.

* Retention Period:
* The Time Travel feature has a retention period, which is the duration for which historical versions of your data are retained.
* By default, Snowflake retains historical data for 1 day. You can configure the retention period when creating a table or changing the retention period for an existing table.
```sql
-- Set the retention period to 7 days for a table
CREATE TABLE my_table (col1 INT, col2 STRING) 
HISTORY_TABLE = (CHANGE_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS => 7);

-- Set the retention period to 30 days for a table
CREATE TABLE my_table (col1 INT, col2 STRING) 
WITH DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 30
```

* System Versioned Table:
* To take advantage of Time Travel, you need to create a table with system versioning enabled. This means the table will retain historical versions of rows.
```sql
-- Create a table with system versioning
CREATE TABLE my_table (col1 INT, col2 STRING) 
SYSTEM_VERSIONING = TRUE;
```

* Querying Historical Data:
* Once a table is set up with system versioning, you can query historical data using the Time Travel feature in your SQL queries.
```sql
-- Query data as of a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM my_table AS OF SYSTEM TIME '2023-01-01 00:00:00';
```
```sql
-- Query data before a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM my_table BEFORE SYSTEM TIME '2023-01-01 00:00:00';
```
* Managing Retention Policy:
* You can also alter the retention policy for an existing table if you need to change the retention period.
```sql
-- Change the retention period for an existing table
ALTER TABLE my_table SET CHANGE_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 14;
```
* Retrive dropped table, works for a max of 90 days and default 1 day.
```sql
UNDROP TABLE my_table;
```

* This will return details about the most recent query that included the specified table name in its text, including its query ID
```sql
SELECT *
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE QUERY_TEXT LIKE '%<table_name>%'
ORDER BY QUERY_START_TIME DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
* session history, For the most recent query: Use `SELECT $SQLID;` or `SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID();`
For specific queries within the current session: 
```sql
SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID(n);
-- where n is the query position (1 for first, 2 for second, etc.).
```

## Snowflake TSQL
### Python UDF (user-defined functions)
* Create Python UDT
```python
def snore(n):   # return a series of n snores
    result = []
    for a in range(n):
        result.append("Zzz")
    return result
```
*  SnowSQL (CLI client) and use the PUT command to copy the file from the local file system to the default user stage, named @~. (The PUT command cannot be executed through the Snowflake GUI.)
```bash 
put
file:///Users/Me/sleepy.py
@~/
auto_compress = false
overwrite = true
;
```
* Import WHL files with put
```bash
snowsql -q "PUT file://C:\hydr8-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl @MYDEMODB.MYSCHEMA.OTHER_PYTHON_PACKAGES AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE OVERWRITE=TRUE"
```

FROM   Z1, Z2
WHERE  Z2.ID = Z1.ID;
```
```sql
EXPLAIN USING TEXT
SELECT Z1.ID, Z2.ID 
FROM   Z1, Z2
WHERE  Z2.ID = Z1.ID;
```

## Clustering and Partitioning
* Clusters and partitions are two different ways to organize data in Snowflake. Clusters organize data within micro-partitions, while partitions divide a table into smaller units.
* Micro-partitions provide the foundational data organization mechanism, ensuring efficient storage and parallel processing.
* Data clustering adds an extra layer of optimization by physically ordering data based on your chosen columns, further enhancing query performance for specific access patterns.
* Time Travel is a form of clustering.

### Hash Partitioning:
* Hash partitioning involves distributing rows across partitions based on a hash function applied to one or more columns.
* This method ensures an even distribution of data among the partitions.
* Hash partitioning is suitable for scenarios where you want to distribute the data evenly across partitions, and you may not have a clear range of values for partitioning.
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  col1 INT,
  col2 STRING
)
```

### Range Partitioning
* Range partitioning involves dividing the data into partitions based on a specified range of values for a chosen column.
* Each partition represents a specific range of values.
* Range partitioning is useful when there are clear ranges for the values in a column, and you want to optimize queries that involve filtering based on those ranges.
```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  col1 INT,
  col2 STRING
)
PARTITION BY RANGE(col1) (
  PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
  PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (200),
  PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (300)
);
```

### Time Travel and Clustering:
* It's important to note that Snowflake's Time Travel feature, which allows accessing historical versions of data, is compatible with partitioning.
* Additionally, Snowflake supports automatic clustering, which organizes data within partitions to improve query performance.
```sql
-- Enable automatic clustering on a table
ALTER TABLE my_table CLUSTER BY (col1);
```
* This command organizes the data within partitions based on the specified clustering key (col1 in this case), making it more efficient for certain types of queries.
* Partitioning in Snowflake can significantly enhance query performance, reduce storage costs, and improve overall data management. * The choice between hash and range partitioning depends on the nature of the data and the types of queries you expect to run.
* It's often a good practice to analyze query patterns and workload characteristics before deciding on the appropriate partitioning strategy.
